# Vision Transformers (ViTs) for Image Analysis

This repository demonstrates the implementation of Vision Transformers (ViTs) for image classification tasks. ViTs have proven effective in capturing global and local relationships within images for accurate analysis.

## Overview

### Architecture

- **Patch Embedding:** Divide input images into fixed-size patches and linearly embed them into sequences.
  
- **Positional Encoding:** Inject positional information to maintain spatial information within the sequence of patches.
  
- **Transformer Encoder:** Comprises multiple Transformer blocks.
  
- **Self-Attention Mechanism:** Allows patches to attend to other patches, capturing relationships within the image.
  
- **Feed-Forward Neural Networks:** Process information from attention mechanisms for higher-level representations.
  
- **Classification Head:** A linear layer for image classification.

### Usage

#### Training

1. **Data Preparation:** Preprocess the dataset into patches and prepare positional encodings.
  
2. **Model Configuration:** Define the ViT architecture, specifying the number of Transformer blocks, attention mechanisms, etc.
  
3. **Training:** Train the ViT model on the prepared dataset for image classification tasks.

#### Inference

1. **Model Loading:** Load the trained ViT model.
  
2. **Prediction:** Apply the model to new images for classification.
